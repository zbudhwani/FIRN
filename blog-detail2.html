<p style="font-style: italic;">Most people want to invest in solar, wind, and other clean energy, but the answer how to do it is not always straightforward.<br>
 <br>
<h5 style="font-size:24px; font-weight: bold;">The limits of residential solar<br></h5>
&#8203;<br>
<p>Take residential solar power as an example. Many people rent, rather than own their own homes. Renters may not be able to convince their landlord to install solar panels on their property, assuming the building could structurally support it. People who live in apartment buildings or multi-family dwellings, even when they own their condominium or unit, are likely to face difficulties getting solar installed on the building, ranging from structural impediments like space availability (rooftops may have HVAC, electrical, or other equipment) to legal restrictions (e.g., CC&amp;Rs, local building codes). And even for single-family dwelling homeowners, a number of factors&mdash;like the amount of shade, the pitch and integrity of the roof, steep upfront financial costs, long payback periods, and other building code limitations&mdash;may render installing solar panels difficult, if not prohibitive.<br></p>
&#8203;<br>
<p>Some municipalities have renewable energy purchasing programs, where consumers pay higher electricity prices in exchange for an assurance that their electricity came from renewable sources. But those programs are not available in every city and county. Nor do they constitute an investment: while they help increase demand for renewable energy, the consumer does not own, or reap the benefits from owning, the clean energy infrastructure behind it.<br>
&#8203;<br> </p>
<h5 style="font-size:24px; font-weight: bold;">Locked out<br></h5>
&#8203;<br>
Some private equity and infrastructure funds allow investors to invest in funds that themselves directly finance large scale renewable energy projects, like large on-shore wind farms, through debt or equity. However, those funds are limited to large institutional investors like pension funds, university endowments, home offices of wealthy families, and other &quot;accredited&quot; investors. Accredited investors are persons or entities allowed to invest in securities that are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, a natural person must have a net worth exceeding $1 million to qualify. That figure excludes the value of their primary residence and any indebtedness that exceeds the value of that home. So, in short, unless you're a millionaire or a large institution, you're out of luck. You are locked out of the opportunity to directly invest in clean energy infrastructure.<br>
 <br>
<h5 style="font-size:24px; font-weight: bold;">So what about the stock market? <br></h5>
 <br>
The stock market provides some opportunities to invest in clean energy, but the options are limited in two key ways.<br>
 <br>
First, large swaths of the United States' clean energy capacity is &quot;off-market.&quot; That is, it is not owned by a public company with shares that can be bought and sold on a U.S. exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ. And second, of the publicly traded U.S. companies that do own renewable energy assets, many of them also invest in fossil fuel power plants, like coal- and gas-fired plants.<br>
&#8203;<br>
<h5 style="font-size:24px; font-weight: bold;">Off-market and out-of-bounds <br></h5>
 <br>
Firn set out to understand just how much renewable energy in the U.S. was &quot;off-market&quot; and therefore out of reach for everyday, non-accredited investors. <br>
 <br>
Using U.S. Energy Information Administration data, Firn compiled a database of all renewable energy assets owners, with assets rated over 1 MW. Those assets included photovoltaic (PV) solar installations, concentrated solar power (CSP) installations, onshore wind farms, geothermal power plants, hydropower dams, and battery storage. Many of those assets were owned outright by single private limited liability companies (LLCs), which were then owned by another parent company. Often, those companies were themselves subsidiaries of larger multinational corporations. By cross-referencing those ownership &quot;trees&quot; with databases on corporate parent-subsidiary relationships, Firn mapped the &quot;true&quot; ownership of more than half the installed renewable energy capacity in the U.S., or around 253 GW of renewable energy, looking at thousands of individual clean energy infrastructure power plants and their ownership structures. That exercise revealed who, or what, owned the nation's clean energy infrastructure and whether an every day investor could invest in it. Here's what we found:<br>
 <br>
Around 75% of U.S. hydroelectric capacity is owned by a governmental entity or other non-traded entities, like cooperatives or irrigation districts. More than 60% of geothermal and 50% of utility-scale battery storage capacity is also off-market (i.e., government owned or privately owned). While public companies own 60%-75% of the installed capacity for solar and wind in the U.S., a third of those companies are foreign domiciled. Foreign domiciled companies present challenges for U.S. investors, as investing in foreign companies usually requires a bank to sponsor an American Depositary Receipt (ADR). If an ADR does not exist, it poses extra difficulties to invest. And even if an ADR is available, U.S. investors must pay additional fees and foreign taxes&mdash;just to own a share of American renewable energy infrastructure.<br>
&#8203;<br>
<h5 style="font-size:24px; font-weight: bold;">Rarely a pure play<br></h5>
&#8203;<br>
So what about those U.S. companies that are publicly traded and own renewable energy infrastructure? When retail investors buy shares of a company on the stock market, the investor owns shares of the entire company, not just the parts they like. For example, many investor-owned utilities that own clean energy assets, like wind farms or utility scale solar installations, also own dirty fossil-fuel power plants. With few exceptions, like Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE: BEP), investors choosing to buy shares of U.S. energy players have little choice but to invest in the whole portfolio, for better or for worse.<br>
&#8203;<br>
<h5 style="font-size:24px; font-weight: bold;">Mutual funds no real answer, either<br></h5>
&#8203;<br>
In the recent years, there has been a growth of clean tech-oriented mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While the emergence of those funds is a welcome sight, they, too, can only invest in the same pool of publicly traded companies (and will pass on the costs of investing in any foreign companies, as well). An analysis of a dozen leading clean tech ETFs and mutual funds reveal that they invest more in upstream companies, like wind turbine or semiconductor manufacturers, than companies that own the infrastructure outright. Owning these funds is analogous to owning lumber mills, concrete manufacturers, and roofing companies in lieu of owning real estate. Of course, investing in companies that help build the clean&mdash;or, at least, stand to gain&mdash;is an important part of a diversified portfolio. But it is no real answer for those who want to invest in projects that actually deploy and operate the technology to produce clean, renewable energy.<br>
&#8203;<br>
<h5 style="font-size:24px; font-weight: bold;">Where Firn comes in<br></h5>
&#8203;<br>
Everyday investors are left with no way to make pure-play investments in the same clean energy assets that institutional and high-net worth investors routinely use to diversify their portfolio. That's where Firn comes in. Firn believes everyday retail investors should be able to access clean energy investments. Using recent changes in securities laws, Firn is building a platform to invest in solar, wind, battery, and other clean energy technology assets&mdash;directly. No fossil fuels, and no foreign taxes. In doing so, we believe we can unlock billions of dollars worth of capital to finance the clean energy transition and mitigate climate change.<br>
